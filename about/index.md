## Intro to Myself

Hello, World! My name is Christian Robles and I've been programming since 2013.

I first became interested in programming in 8th grade. I was in an engineering class where we all had to build one continuous assembly line for transporting a wooden block. I was responsible for programming the beginning of the assembly line using a language similar to Robot-C. I remember being immediately attracted to the problem solving that comes with coding and how the code just worked. It does exactly what you ask it to. Plus doing an entire semester worth of work in 4 lines of code was pretty cool too...

## Education

After middle school, I went to a magnet high school with a Computer Science program. There I truly learned how to program with **Visual Basic**, **C++**, and **Java**. I graduated in 2017 and a couple days after the ceremony I started working as full-stack web developer where I still am today.

I used the developer position to put myself through college. In 2022, I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from UNLV. While there I took courses learning about Data Structures and Algorithms, Assembly and CPUs, Operating Systems, Networks, Compilers, and much more.

## Work Experience

As a full-stack developer, I taught myself the **LAMP stack** (**Linux**, **Apache**, **MySQL**, and **PHP**) with the help of the programmers who worked there, [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and the languages' documentation. I also learned **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and multiple PHP frameworks such as **Symfony**, **Smarty**, and **F3**. The main application I worked on was the company's CMS website doing a wide array of projects. Those projects included:
- a HR Management Module with onboarding forms, a write up system, and PTO calculator based off Nevada law and an employee's timecards
- a Timecard System that tied to the shift, time off, and employee building access systems I created
- a Fleet Tracking Service that communicated with the vehicles' GPS through an API
- an Auto Clock In feature for field techs based off the data from the fleet tracking service and their scheduled jobs

Now that I have graduated, I finally have more time to pursue [personal projects](/projects/) and follow my curiosity.

## GitHub

I plan on uploading my **cheatsheets** there.

I'm aspiring to be a better programmer by learning more about programming languages and concepts. While I learn, I like creating cheatsheets to help me fully understand something and to reference in the future. I grab information that I find useful from multiple sources including official documentation. I don't plan on making them perfect or to teach someone not familiar with the language/concept everything they need to know, but more of a quick reference and some notes on trickier subjects.

I hope uploading them will help somebody! Please feel free to submit pull requests to fix them up / add to them!

### My Cheatsheets

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrobles/github-cheatsheet)
2. [Markdown](https://github.com/chrisrobles/markdown-cheatsheet)
3. [Git](https://github.com/chrisrobles/git-cheatsheet)

## other

Although I took a course on Data Structures and Algorithms, I feel like I did not get a good sense on how to apply them. So, I'm going over each concept slowly to fully understand their use cases and weaknesses.

I'm also learning Python 3 to practice them in.
