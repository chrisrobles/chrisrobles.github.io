# GitHub

I wanted to learn more about Git and the tools available on Github. So, I read through a lot of Github's documentation and tutorials. After I felt I learned enough about 

I plan on uploading my **cheatsheets** there.

I'm aspiring to be a better programmer by learning more about programming languages and concepts. While I learn, I like creating cheatsheets to help me fully understand something and to reference in the future. I grab information that I find useful from multiple sources including official documentation. I don't plan on making them perfect or to teach someone not familiar with the language/concept everything they need to know, but more of a quick reference and some notes on trickier subjects.

I hope uploading them will help somebody! Please feel free to submit pull requests to fix them up / add to them!
